      <title>Hi, I&#39;m Hassan - I love building things and helping people achieve their potential</title>

      <description>I grew up in Rawalpindi, Pakistan. I learned early on the importance of education/skills, getting things done, hustle, resilience, and curiosity - Special thanks to my parents for it!
After high school, I attended the University of British Columbia (UBC) on a full-ride scholarship. My experience at UBC taught me the importance of building relationships, story-telling, authenticity, recognizing opportunities and continuous growth. It also gave me the chance to expose myself to a variety of things, allowing me to grow 10X.</description>
